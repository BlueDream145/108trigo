# 108trigo
Epitech Project, MATHS 108

Subject:

As you may know (or not), the exponential function you know so well can be written as the sum of a power series.
So does many other functions, like trigonomertic and hyperbolic functions.
These power series are extremely handy when it comes to fast approximations of all those functions. But they can
also be used to exponentiate (for instance) mathematical objects (as far as they can be elevated to integer powers).
One could for example compute the cosine of a function, the exponentiate of a graph, the hyperbolic tangent of a
rotation or the sine of a square matrix (what you will do)...
Given a matrix and the name of a function, your programm will apply the latter to the former, and print the result.

Usage:

./108trigo fun a0 a1 a2....

fun   function to be applied, among at least "EXP", "COS", "SIN", "COSH" and "SINH"
ai    coeficients of the matrix
